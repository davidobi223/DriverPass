# DriverPass
The DriverPass project was based around a company that wanted to have an online multiplatform driving school. In person driving lessons are available for customers too. The system is also ran off of a third party cloud based service as well. The best part of this project for me was when I had to construct different diagrams I excelled in that department. If I could improve anything about this project I would have liked to make more activity diagrams to showcase more of the working parts of the system. When it comes to user needs I usually take down notes of what they requested during the interview and I would try my best to implement those ideas into the new system. User needs are important becuase they show that the company is listening to the customers and this can produce a very happy base of customers which important for any company to have. Lastly, whenever I am designing software I take my time and do as much research as possible. This process helps me come up with different ideas that I can implement into the software that's being built. For future reference I would like to work  with different students on a project just so I can see how everyone else is thinking when they are making software, system designs, and diagrams.
